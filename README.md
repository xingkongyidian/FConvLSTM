# FConvLSTM A fuzzy-based convolutional LSTM network approach for citywide traffic flow prediction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Dependencies:
FConvLSTM using the following dependencies:
* Keras and its dependencies
* Theano or TensorFlow, but Theano is recommended
* numpy and scipy
* HDF5 and h5py
* CUDA 7.5 or latest version. And cuDNN is highly recommended.

# data
